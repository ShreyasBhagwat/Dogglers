Dogglers App
==================================
Dogglers app shows scrolling lists of Googlers' pet dogs along with a bit of information about each one, such as their name, age, hobbies, and a photo.

In this project, I have build layouts for the RecyclerView items in the Dogglers app, and implement an adapter so that the list of dogs can be presented three ways: by horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling, and vertically scrolling grid layout.

<h3>Screenshots</h3>

<div class="row">
      <h4>Main Page</h4>
      <img src="/Screenshots/1.png" width="250" title="Main Page"> <br>
      <h4>Layouts </h4>
      <h4>Vertical Scroll</h4>
      <img src="/Screenshots/2.png" width="250" title="Vertical Scroll">
      <h4>Horizontal Scroll</h4>
      <img src="/Screenshots/3.png" width="250" title="Horizontal Scroll">
      <h4>Grid View</h4>
      <img src="/Screenshots/4.png" width="250" title="Grid View">
      
</div>
