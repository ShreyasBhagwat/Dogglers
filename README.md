Dogglers App
==================================
Dogglers app shows scrolling lists of Googlers' pet dogs along with a bit of information about each one, such as their name, age, hobbies, and a photo.
In this project, I have build layouts for the RecyclerView items in the Dogglers app, and implement an adapter so that the list of dogs can be presented three ways: by horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling, and vertically scrolling grid layout.
